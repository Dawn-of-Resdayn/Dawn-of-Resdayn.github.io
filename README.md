features:
- title: Characters First
  details: Here we put player characters first, where everything you do impacts every little minute attention to detail, and ongoing story.
- title: Custom Scripts and Modded ESPs
  details: "We use custom scripts and modded ESPs to help tailor, provide tools, and enrich your roleplaying experience; that are actively worked on to be perfected."
- title: Long-term Storytelling
  details: Players can come together and tell their stories, dependent of one another, to conform to a larger, more custom and persistent story that effects everyone. All NPCs from the original game aside from critical ones for storytelling, such as Vivec- are voided or removed so that the players may take their place.
