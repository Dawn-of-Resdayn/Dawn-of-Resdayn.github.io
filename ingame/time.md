# Time

At Dawn of Resdayn, our 'time is frozen' at [3E 426](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#3E_426), following our own persistent timeline operating a seperate calendar (Dawn Awakening), with important positions and individuals changed and taken by active player characters; minus tribunal gods.

Time passes for characters at Dawn of Resdayn faster than it does for us in real life. The ratio is 3:1, meaning there are three in-game hours for each real-life hour.

## Faction Information

At this time, it being 'frozen' on the official lore calendar, the faction disposition is generally this:

* The Tribunal Temple are on it's toes after the recent gathering of Sixth House forces from beyond the ghostgate. With the recent stealing of the tools, and the rise of The Dissident Priests, the temple hold no rest for swiftly punishing and delivering the brand of the heretic.

* House Redoran are, as always, upholding sworn tradition, and adherent to the faith of the Tribunal. They allow mostly any races into their ranks, as long as they abide by their customs, culture, and embrace the banner of House Redoran; and the many precipitating houses that endow it's power circle.

* House Telvanni are becoming slowly annoyed by their imperial and mage guild guests, they banning and outlawing many acts they deem unnecessary, imposing the levitation act, and attempting to reprimand the houses' use of slave trade and ritual necromancy. They are still as treacherous, and powerful as ever as a house. Producing the most feared and respected dunmeri the lands of Tamriel has ever seen.

* Sixth House is at the highest potential of their prowess, the sharmat possessing the tools of Kagrenac. They build their forces behind the ghostgate, and claim dreamers every dawning eve. They work covertly from the shadows to seed chaos among invading outlanders, assasinating key targets; and abducting many.

* The Empire is generally handling the occupation of Morrowind well, the lands providing plenty of taxation. Inhabitants of Cyrodiil are finding the lands and nature of Morrowind to be treacherous, and extremely uninhabitable for their tastes. So, to further expand their influence yet remaining offshore; imperial levies and individual legions are housed across Morrowind, recruiting locales and other indigenous peoples for it's manpower, under order of the Duke of Ebonheart and King of Mournhold.

* House Hlaalu are up the imperial skirts, as they say, forever indulging in the profit to be gained and hailing the calls of bureaucracy.

* House Dres are dealing with the imperials' recent attempted appeals of the slave trade, otherwise- they reign prosperous; serving a reminder of the shackle and iron that may threat any outsider and beast race of Morrowind.

* The various Ashlander tribes remain undisturbed, by order of the tribunal and Vivec, the ashlanders are respectfully left alone by their tribunal neighbors. However, due to the modernization of the other houses, and cohesion with the temple in regards to the Nerevarine Prophecies; their lands are becoming all too few, and they huddle far and wide between Red Mountain and other large plains of Vvardenfell, living out the old velothian ways.

The rest is up to the players to peruse, explore, and expand upon at Dawn of Resdayn.
