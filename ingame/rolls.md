# Rolls
We use a custom roll system tailored toward roleplay instead of a "random" or "mechanical" roll system. Our roll system relies on skill set by the player on a per character basis, instead of relying on character skills built into the game. This is to avoid people grinding to get their skills to high level just so they can "roll" other players whom are trying to have a good RP experience.\
Our rolling system is kind of similar to D&D rolls, as in it's a ``d20`` based die with bonuses based on your skill level and critical hits. So, if you have played D&D before this system mechanic's will probably seem slightly familiar to you.\
Any further questions you have about the rolling system, please feel free to ask on our Discord.

You can roll an attribute an attribute by doing ``/roll attr <attribute>``. Example: ``/roll attr strength`` will roll a d20 die for the strength attribute.\
You can do a skill roll by doing ``/roll skill <skill>``. Example: ``/roll skill armorer`` will roll a d20 die for your armorer skill.

## Leveling and Points
::: warning
To have your skills reset please make a ticket in our Discord. Only staff can reset your skills.
:::
When you create a new character you will be given ``80`` points to put into whatever skill you want. A DM can give you more points for good behavior, or simply play time.\

The max level for a skill is ``100``, and every ``15`` points in a skill equals a ``+1`` to your roll. Example: Player a has 25 points in his Hand to Hand combat, so when he does ``/roll skill handtohand``, he will roll a d20 with a +2 to his roll.

Doing ``/skills`` will bring up your character sheet with your skill levels.\
You can level your skills by doing ``/levelskill <skill> <points>``. Example: ``/levelskill handtohand 75`` will put 75 of your available points into your handtohand skill.

## Skills

## Combat
When dealing with RP based combat you have to roll one of the combat skills. It is up to you to keep track of your RP health. We're trusting our players not to lie about their RP health, but keep in mind **anyone** can view your skills and your RP health so lying will result DMs getting involved.

#### Criticals
Each combat roll has a ``5%`` static chance of getting a critical. Getting a critical will result in a ``+3`` to your combat roll. Below is a list of skills that can be affected by critical hits.
```
handtohand
axe
longblade
bluntweapon
shortblade
marksman
```

#### Critical Failures
If you end up rolling a ``1`` for your roll, your roll will be **+0** bonus no matter your skill/attribute level is.

## Attributes
Your skill level will directly affect your attribute rolls. The calculations for how your attribute bonus is determined by your [skill levels](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Skills).\
This is the math formula that is used for those math people out there. ``(skill level + skill level + skill level + skill level)/25``
