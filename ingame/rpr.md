# Roleplay Rating

Here at Dawn of Resdayn, we gatekeep elevated opportunities based on your roleplaying experience and desire to play.
Your roleplaying rating is static to your account, and anonymously edited based on your performance.
Upon creating new characters, with your identity confirmed - DMs will adjust your overall rating to your global, static value.


There is several levels of RPR, which we'll explain here.

* RPR 10 - All players start here.
* RPR 20 - Players who are noticably interested, and appear to be experienced roleplayers; are commonly boosted to this level.
* RPR 30 - Players who have completed several remarkable story arcs and maintained activity on the server, with multiple kudos threads to their name.
* RPR 40 - Players with severe dedication, playing for quite a long time and understand the realistic proportions of roleplay that we are, as DMs, attempting to achieve. They've left a lot of good work to their name. (They can refer others to becoming RPR 20 without the DM supervision)
* RPR 50 - This RPR is reserved for characters that have earned high feats of power, such as saints, gods, etcetera.

Players can request a DM ticket where their RP is observed for a time on a set date, so that their RPR can be adjusted accordingly. Keep in mind that their RPR may not always be adjusted when observed, and the DM can leave and stop participating anytime.

## Epic Sacrifice

Dawn of Resdayn presents many great, locked opportunities for you; but they come at a price.
At your respective rating level, you can PK your character for a dice roll, with DM consensus - for the chance to gain a redeemable award.
You may use higher-ranking awards for less valued ones. (e.g: Using a Major Award for an interesting opportunity granted in a Greater.)

**Some Disclaimers**
* Players cannot become nobles without perusing the nobility award. Others must acknowledge you as a liar, or too good to be true without the award.
* Some options may not be available by using the standard, starting races- we'll help you get configured if these cases occur.
* (**!**) Exclamation marks that follow certain awards, indicate that they require a strong application to the DM team.
* Players with **RPR 10** cannot participate in the Epic Sacrifice program. They must first become elevated by a DM with proper RP, or by an individual with **RPR 40** to **RPR 20**.
* If you wish to see more opportunities added, you may suggest- within the realm of possibility, plausible awards under respective categories with a DM ticket.

**The Calculating Formula**
* Players are determined their award choice by a basic formula as follows:

*RPR + D100(5% vs 90%)*
