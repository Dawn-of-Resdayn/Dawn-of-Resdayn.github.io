# Privacy
[Authorized server staff](https://dor.winterfang.com/project/privacy.html#authorized-staff) have access to player files, which means they have access to view **IP address** used to connect to via game server and your in-game character **passwords**. It is recommended when creating your character you use a password that is not used **anywhere else**.

Below is a full list of our staff team that have access to the information as said above. To avoid being _dox_ do NOT give your **IP address** to anyone UNLESS they are part of [authorized staff list](https://dor.winterfang.com/project/privacy.html#authorized-staff).

## Account Recovery
The account recovery process involves the user providing their IP address, and answering custom tailored security questions in regards to their account. It is important that you provide your answers to someone on the [authorized staff list](https://dor.winterfang.com/project/privacy.html#authorized-staff) when asked too in a DM.

This section also applies for password changes. Your account/character can be deleted by using the ``/delete`` command in game.
