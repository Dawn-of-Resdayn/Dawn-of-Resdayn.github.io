# Introduction
We are a serious roleplay server on TES3MP called Dawn of Resdayn!
We've been around for the latter half of three or more years, providing a serious roleplaying environment with custom scripts, mods, and painstaking attention to lore detail.
We have high enforced DM expectations and DM policies to have realistic roleplaying proportions, and outcomes in our persistent world and story.
If your character concept seems too unrealistic or lore breaking, you will be given chances to modify it- or it could be denied of playing.
Trolls and toxic nuisances will and can be removed without warning. Be responsible, considerate players and adults when you use our website, forums, and game server!

Installation is just steps away, by consulting our [installation](https://dor.winterfang.com/guides/installing.html) page.

We suggest you read our rules and DM policies on our [discord](https://discord.gg/XG8r27R) and [forums](https://resdayn.boards.net/thread/3/discord-game-server-forum-rules).
Not reading the rules is not a tolerable excuse.

# New to Roleplaying?
If your not interested in roleplaying, then this server is likely not for you.
If your into mechanically playing, grinding out your stats, and playing co-op; then we suggest you find other servers or create your own.
You may indulge in mechanically grinding out your characters, but everything your character does must be in-character and ready to accept consequence.

We do not judge new roleplayers and ARE always willing to help teach aspiring learners.
Our server does not use mechanical systems to determine roleplay. Everything is text based, and with our new combat rolls system by Wishbone (Saintwish) the combat is more streamlined in a storytelling fashion.

# DM Policy on Permadeath and Character Restraint
As of right now, players must consent to their character being killed, but there may be other options out of your control.
As per consequence of your characters actions, if you become trapped in a soul gem- that is what we like to call, "lite" or "diet" permadeath. You can be restored, otherwise you are imprisoned for a definite duration from playing your character. The same thing applies to your character being rightfully imprisoned by house retainers, ordinators, or imperial guards. You may be forced to create another player character to continue playing until you are freed in any or all circumstances in the roleplaying scenario.

# DM Policy on Erotic Roleplay and other 18+ activities
For attention to lore and detail, these are the lands of Morrowind. Dunmer are very promiscuous. We allow a thin line of ice for tolerance in these types of scenarios for the sake of character progression and personal stories, relationships, etcetera etcetera.
Before you consider engaging intimate relations with other player characters, please inform the DMs. This is required, and if found otherwise is prohibited.
The DMs will not open the logs, nor read or share your roleplay. However, you are both (as players) required to confirm your age and consent, or you could risk the possibility of both and all being permanently banned. Under no circumstances shall anyone be forced to partake in these roleplay scenarios.
Creepy or predatory players that stretch OOC boundaries will and can be removed without warning and permanently banned- with possible further action.
