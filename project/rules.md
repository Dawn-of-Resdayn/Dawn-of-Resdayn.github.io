## In-game "rules" and laws
It is highly suggested and recommended you go through and read our in-game imperial laws, and their subsidies here:
* [Imperial Law](https://resdayn.boards.net/thread/6/imperial-law)
* [House Indoril/Temple Law](https://resdayn.boards.net/thread/71/provincial-temple-laws)
* [House Dres Laws](https://resdayn.boards.net/thread/292/laws-great-house-dres) (**REVAMP NEEDED**)

You may be subject to them, so it is important to know why, and how your toon may be getting in trouble; and what you can do to refute it.
